Project 1
=========
This project is an implementation of a basic SIS database.

The program reads in a database of student and course files and allows for the
addition/removal of students and courses.

DISCLAIMER: This code is gross. The goal was to get memory usage under 31,000
            bytes. Many of the coding practices seen here would never be
            used in a reasonable implementation of such a system.
